>  This is a simple real world application where users can write short tweets, follow each other and also chat with each other. This project follows MVC pattern and I have used NoSQL Database(MongoDB) for storing user data. For chat functionality I have used Socket.io. and EJS is used as a Template Engine for server side rendering.
